## Target problem
In modern architectures, such as microservices, event-driven systems, or serverless (Lambda) architectures, a common issue arises in managing the number of open connections to relational databases. When applications need to elastically scale, they often maintain too many database connections. These connections can be held for longer than necessary, locking resources and making scalability difficult. In some cases, this can lead to excessive resource consumption, placing immense pressure on the database. In extreme scenarios, this can even result in database outages.

## The solution
OJP provides a smart proxy to solve this problem by dynamically managing database connections. Rather than keeping connections open continuously, OJP only allocates real database connections when an operation is performed. The proxy ensures that resources are used efficiently by allocating connections only when truly necessary. For example, a real connection to the database is established only when an actual operation (e.g., a query or update) is performed, thus optimizing resource usage and ensuring better scalability.
This intelligent allocation of connections helps prevent overloading databases and ensures that the number of open connections remains efficient, even during heavy elastic scaling of applications.
