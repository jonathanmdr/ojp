## Components

### ojp-server
The ojp-server is a gRPC server that manages a HikariCP connection pool and abstracts the creation and management of database connections. It supports one or multiple relational databases and provides virtual connections to the ojp-jdbc-driver. The server ensures the number of open real connections is always under control, according to predefined settings, improving database scalability.

### ojp-jdbc-driver
The ojp-jdbc-driver is an implementation of the JDBC specification. It connects to the ojp-server via the gRPC protocol, sending SQL statements to be executed against the database and reading the responses. The driver works with virtual connections provided by the ojp-server, allowing the application to interact with the database without directly managing real database connections.

#### Important: Disable your application's connection pool

When using OJP, disable any existing connection pooling in your application (such as HikariCP, C3P0, or DBCP2) since OJP handles connection pooling at the proxy level. This prevents double-pooling and ensures optimal performance.

**Important**: OJP will not work properly if another connection pool is enabled on the application side. Make sure to disable all application-level connection pooling before using OJP.

### ojp-grpc-commons
The ojp-grpc-commons module contains the shared gRPC contracts used between the ojp-server and ojp-jdbc-driver. These contracts define the communication protocol and structure for requests and responses exchanged between the server and the driver.
