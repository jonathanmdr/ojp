## Value Proposition

OJP protects your databases from overwhelming connection storms by acting as a smart backpressure mechanism. Instead of every application instance opening and holding connections, OJP orchestrates and optimizes database access through intelligent pooling, query flow control, and multi-database support. With minimal configuration changes, you replace native JDBC drivers gaining connection resilience, and safer scalability. Elastic scaling becomes simpler without putting your database at risk.

---
## Quick Start

Get OJP running in under 5 minutes:

### 1. Start OJP Server
```bash
docker run --rm -d --network host rrobetti/ojp:0.2.0-beta
```

### 2. Add OJP JDBC Driver to your project
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjproxy</groupId>
    <artifactId>ojp-jdbc-driver</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0-beta</version>
</dependency>
```

### 3. Update your JDBC URL
Replace your existing connection URL by prefixing with `ojp[host:port]_`:

```java
// Before (PostgreSQL example)
"jdbc:postgresql://user@localhost/mydb"

// After  
"jdbc:ojp[localhost:1059]_postgresql://user@localhost/mydb"

// Oracle example
"jdbc:ojp[localhost:1059]_oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/XEPDB1"

// SQL Server example
"jdbc:ojp[localhost:1059]_sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=mydb"
```
Use the ojp driver: `org.openjproxy.jdbc.Driver`

That's it! Your application now uses intelligent connection pooling through OJP.

## Alternative Setup: Executable JAR (No Docker)

If Docker is not available in your environment, you can build and run OJP Server as a standalone JAR file:

## Documentation
### High Level Solution

<img src="documents/designs/ojp_high_level_design.gif" alt="OJP High Level Design" />

* The OJP JDBC driver is used as a replacement for the native JDBC driver(s) previously used with minimal change, the only change required being prefixing the connection URL with `ojp_`. 
* **Open Source**: OJP is an open-source project that is free to use, modify, and distribute.
* The OJP server is deployed as an independent service that serves as a smart proxy between the application(s) and their respective relational database(s), controlling the number of connections open against each database.
* **Smart Connection Management**: The proxy ensures that database connections are allocated only when needed, improving scalability and resource utilization.
* **Elastic Scalability**: OJP allows client applications to scale elastically without increasing the pressure on the database.
* **gRPC Protocol** is used to facilitate the connection between the OJP JDBC Driver and the OJP Server, allowing for efficient data transmission over a multiplexed channel.
* OJP Server uses **HikariCP** connection pools to efficiently manage connections.
* OJP supports **multiple relational databases** - in theory it can support any relational database that provides a JDBC driver implementation.
* OJP simple setup just requires the OJP library in the classpath and the OJP prefix added to the connection URL (e.g., `jdbc:ojp[host:port]_h2:~/test` where `host:port` represents the location of the OJP server).

## Vision
Provide a free and open-source solution for a relational database-agnostic proxy connection pool. The project is designed to help efficiently manage database connections in microservices, event-driven architectures, or serverless environments while maintaining high scalability and performance.
